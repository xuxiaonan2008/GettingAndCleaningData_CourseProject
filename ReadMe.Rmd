## Introduction 

This is my submission for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data. What I want to do is for the following five tasks:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## About the results

1. For the task 1 to 4, my result can be found in the file named "TidyData_task1-4.csv". 
2. For the task 5 you can find the result named with "TidyData_task5.txt" within the respo.

3. The analysis lines are shown as comments in the run_analysis.R
